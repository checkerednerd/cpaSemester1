In completing this workshop, I feel like I have the ability to begin a simple C programming source file, compile, and run it. I am now aware that I need to include the Standard Input/Output Header in order to build a program that takes input or displays output, as well as the command for printing text to the screen. 

In addition, I have learned about transferring our code to a remote Linux machine and compiling using a command-line interface. In doing so, I have seen that the code I created is compatible with a Windows and a Linux compiler. Also, in viewing the file sizes of the in-lab vs. the at-home lab source files, the increase in code size is reflected by the much larger at-home source file.
