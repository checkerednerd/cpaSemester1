1) A function is a block of code that performs a specific (cohesive) task, 
as per the instructions specified in the block of code that makes up its body.
It can be accessed multiple times across different modules to perform its task,
which greatly reduces the need for redundant coding. This is beneficial to any
programming language because A) It saves the programmer time from having to
type out code that we have already written somewhere for that purpose, and B) it
reduces the amount of code that makes up a program, as entire statements are
reduced to function calls, making the program easier to read and maintain.

2) I believe the "helper" function are in a different module than the rest of the
functions on "contacts" to help differentiate the purposes of the functions within.
The "helper" functions are more general in purpose: validating a character input,
storing an integer, comparing to a range, etc. These functions are tools that are
called by each other, and the functions in the "contact" module to help them do
their own functions, which are more specific to the purpose of populating the
structures.
