3) findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone were benificial to the maintainability/readability
of my source code, in that these functions were called upon numerous times by other functions
to complete their own tasks. In putting the code for findContactIndex and getTenDigitPhone
into seperate functions, we greatly reduced the amount of redundant code that needed to be written.
Had we not have done this, we would have needed to write the code for each of these every time we
used them. This would be a waste of time, a waste of memory, and would greatly
hinder the readability of our code - as there would be dozens if not hundreds of additional,
redundant lines of code.

4) From doing Assignment 2, I gained a stronger appreciation for the expandability of structures
and arrays for storing data. Early on in this assignment, we populated structures with
members, and structures with arrays of members (such as strings). As the assignment has grown in
scale, the scale of our variables and structures has increased along with it. By Milestone 4, I 
can now appreciate that we can create arrays of structures, structures of arrays, and most 
recently, an array of structures that contain structures (contactList[].name.firstName in my 
case), and so forth. While this can appear confusing, the simplistic relationship between data 
structures allows me to better understand how data is stored and passed through a program.
