1) I believe this assignment asked us to code a struct that holds other structs because this can
assist in the ability to reuse some of the earlier code, minimizing the number of variables needed.
For example, if the code were to be expanded to allow the user to enter more contacts, we could put
the contact info into a running amalgimation (such as Contact, in our case) and overwrite the
previous values on the Name, Address, and Numbers objects for the next cases, and repeat.

2) This assignment proved to be quite difficult, as I am not entirely sure that I completely
understood the exact requirements of each function. While my code works in the sense that it 
is per my understanding of the instructions, I was unable to initialize the structure Contact
as empty, and instead initialized it with the contents received from Name, Address, and 
Numbers before displaying it. It felt that between understanding pointers, functions, and
structures within structures, the difficulty curve was fairly steep on this one.

3) It took about 12 or so hours over the course of 3 days on this one, that includes referrencing
the chapters in the book, doing extra research online, and trying to understand the new syntax.
