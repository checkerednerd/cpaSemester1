1) It would be more efficient to ask the user for more data per prompt, and process
the data accordingly. For example, in the case of the full name, ask the user for the full
name at once, and use the spaces provided by the user input to deliminiate field seperation.
Doing this, you can even avoid having to ask the user if there is a middle initial. The program
could determine that if there is only 1 space, there must be 2 names - a first and last. Any
more than this would indicate that at least one middle initial was entered.

2) A C string is required to contain 1 more character than the size to be stored
because space is required in the array for the null terminator at the end. The null terminator
is represented by the character \0 and specifies the end of an array of characters (which
we call a string).
