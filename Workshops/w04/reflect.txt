1) The arrays in this program have to be declared to hold 10 elements because in order to initialize the array and fill it with values, we either need to specify its size, or specify the elements during the declaration statement - which will determine the array size. As we do not yet know the values that will populate the array, we will specify its size as the maximum allowable value for our purpose.

2) An advantage to using matching arrays is that they are simple to evaluate and extract data from. For example, an array element in array 1 at index 5 will always produce the corresponding data from array 2 at index 5 - this makes it incredibly easy for loops to process entire arrays easily. One of the disadvantages is that one must take care when formatting the output of matching arrays, as various value sizes can easily throw off the readability of the output.

3) I feel that the at-home portion of the workshop was just right. We went from processing a single array in the in-lab to evaluating two arrays in parallel. This felt like a very natural progression, and allowed me to experience firsthand one of the many practical uses for arrays - a key and value pairing. The complexity of the coding required for the at-home was essentially on-par with that of the in-lab - the increase in challenge was mostly attributed to dealing with the logic behind managing two matching arrays.
