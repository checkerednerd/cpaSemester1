Version 1.0.0
Objective: write a C program that will replicate a generic old-school RPG battle. This first version will feature you vs. a single enemy "Skeleton".
You will have a choice of abilities: FIGHT, MAGIC, DEFEND, FLEE.
Magic will feature a submenu containing the spells: FIRE, ICE, BOLT, back, wherein back will return to the previous menu.
You will have 20 health, and the Skeleton will strike at you with a basic FIGHT command that will deal between 2-5 base damage.
You will have a defense stat that will randomly negate between 1-3 damage.
In addition, you will have a dodge stat that will have a 20% chance of taking zero damage.
Skeleton will take an additional 50% damage from the FIRE spell.
Fight will deal between 2-5 base damage, "Skeleton" will have a defense stat to negate between 1-2 damage, and will not have a dodge stat.
If the player chooses to DEFEND, their defense stat will increase to 3-5, negative most or all of the damage.
The battle continues until the user's HP reaches 0, the "Skeleton"'s HP reaches zero, or the user selects FLEE.
